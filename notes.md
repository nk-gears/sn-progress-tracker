  3. Performance: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimized builds
  4. Maintainability: Separation of concerns, reusable components
  5. Scalability: Easy to add new features and extend functionality
  6. Developer Experience: Hot reload, linting, type checking
  7. User Experience: Smooth animations, better feedback, mobile optimization

  🛠️ Available Commands

  npm run dev          # Development server
  npm run build        # Production build
  npm run preview      # Preview production build
  npm run type-check   # TypeScript checking
  npm run lint         # Code linting

  🔄 Migration Benefits

  - Maintainable: Clean separation of concerns with proper architecture
  - Scalable: Easy to add new features, branches, or user types
  - Performance: Faster loading with code splitting and optimization
  - Developer Friendly: TypeScript, hot reload, and proper tooling
  - Production Ready: Built-in error handling, validation, and optimization

  The new Vue.js 3 application maintains all the functionality from your original mobile.html while providing a much more robust, maintainable,
  and scalable foundation for future development. You can now easily add new features, maintain the codebase, and deploy with confidence.
